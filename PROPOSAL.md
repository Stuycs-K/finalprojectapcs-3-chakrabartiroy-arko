# IDEAS:

1. Platformer Game (with graphics), possibly similar in layout to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/292297781/. Include playable characters that can jump, move left/right, etc., collectables (e.g. coins), terrain (e.g. different types of platforms), enemies, possibly a scoring mechanism.

2 Monopoly--played on the terminal, user can type commands to do stuff (e.g. "roll dice", "buy property") etc. Internal representation of Monopoly board, users can buy and sell properties and move along the board, just like in Monopoly. https://www.solitaireparadise.com/games_list/monopoly.html for reference.

3 stabfish--similar in design to stabfish.io or deeeep.io; players move around and try to kill other fish to gain points. Has graphics and you can control your player on the screen with keyboard commands or with the mouse.
