Expanded Description:

### Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.

1. A working player sprite that can move around (controls would be arrow keys and maybe WASD) and jump (with gravity mechanics implemented) with up/W/space key
2. Platform sprites that function as "ground" and stuff that player can jump on and move on
3. Collectibles (e.g. coins) spawning in different (possibly randomized) places
4. Enemies (e.g. spikes, lava) spawning in different places; if player touches these, player dies and respawns at beginning(?) of level
5. Gravity (mentioned in #1 but this deserves a bullet of its own here because of its importance in any platformer)--player jumping, falling, etc
6. Either set levels (static or scrolling) or infinite scrolling

Diagrams can be useful (but will expand this to an extra page if you use them) when your project isn't EXTREMELY well known (e.g. chess, tetris) but you need to annoatate them to explain what you care about.

Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end
