Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary):

Scrolling platformer game, with multiple levels and various features, such as enemies and collectibles. The player can be controlled with arrow keys (and maybe WASD). Processing will be used for graphics, including the "world", player movement (including gravity), enemy movement, rendering of sprites, etc. Scoring (i will murder my shift keys after writing this) will be based on time (i.e. the less time you take to complete the level, the better). Later/more challenging levels will only be unlocked after the previous levels are completed (however, to ensure that total noobs are able to still play (and fail miserably at) multiple levels, the first three levels will be unlocked at the beginning).



Expanded Description:

### Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.

1. A working player sprite that can move around (controls would be arrow keys and maybe WASD) and jump (with gravity mechanics implemented) with up/W/space key
2. Platform sprites that function as "ground" and stuff that player can jump on and move on
3. Collectibles (e.g. coins) spawning in different (possibly randomized) places
4. Enemies (e.g. spikes, lava) spawning in different places; if player touches these, player dies and respawns at beginning(?) of level
5. Gravity (mentioned in #1 but this deserves a bullet of its own here because of its importance in any platformer)--player jumping, falling, etc
6. Either set levels (static or scrolling) or infinite scrolling

Diagrams can be useful (but will expand this to an extra page if you use them) when your project isn't EXTREMELY well known (e.g. chess, tetris) but you need to annoatate them to explain what you care about.

### Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end


1. Wall jumping
2. **Different types of platforms that have different functions (examples of this below):**
3. Floating platforms
4. Moving platforms (i.e. sliders)
5. Teleporters
6. Trampolines
7. Ground holes/caves (think beginning of gen. red lvl 3)
8. Clouds (functioning as temporary platforms that disappear shortly after you jump on them)
9. **Different types of enemies/danger that do different things (examples of this below):**
10. Lava
11. Spikes
12. Moving spikes
13. Moving spears/arrows
14. "Big Green" (think beginning of gen. red lvl 1)
15. Rotating maces
16. "Spikie"s (see gen. red sprites), these are rotating I believe
17. "Blade"s (see gen. red sprites), not a great name but these things are circular rotating with spikes around circumference
