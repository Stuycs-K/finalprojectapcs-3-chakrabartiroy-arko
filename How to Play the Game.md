**Controls**

- **Arrow Right / Left** – move the character horizontally.
    
- **Arrow Up** – jump. Double‑jump is disabled; you must land before jumping again.
    
- **Space** – _dev reset_ (teleports player & camera back to the starting platform).
    
    

**Objective**

1. Collect **all the coins** (displayed at the top‑left as `Coins X / Y`).
    
2. Once every coin is collected, the exit portal at the far right of the level is enabled
    
3. Touch the glowing portal to complete the level and see the “YOU PASSED!” screen.
    

**Hazards**

- **Spikes** – touching a spike triggers a death sequence: the player flashes, a red “You Died!” appears, then the level resets.
    
- **Falling Off‑Screen** – if the player’s Y‑coordinate drops below the window, the same death reset is triggered.

- **Spears** - touching a spear triggers the same death sequence as for spikes.
    

**Debug Aids**

- Press **space** to instantly reset player, camera, platforms, spikes, portal, and uncollected coins (helpful while demonstrating).
    
    

**Visual Cues**

- Portal inactive while any coin remains (easily visible, as there is a red **X** across it). Once the player has collected every coin, the exit is active.
